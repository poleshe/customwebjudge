# Custom Web Judge

This project was created for the final project on the DAW superior grade on INS La Pineda. All content is made using Django (Python), PostgreSQL and Selenium.

Custom Web Judge is an open-source tool that allows everyone to create automatically-corrected exercises, and publish them on a in-built feed.

The exercises are corrected using a series of steps created by the owner of the exercise, that are then executed on a remote dockerized-browser using Selenium.

Then, everyone can upload a .JS file containing the answer of the exercise. It will be corrected automatically depending on the original steps, and a veredict will be sent.

For more info, installation and tests, refer to the PDF documentation (written in Catalan language) on:
